## About this project

In an attempt to bring some order to the coat closet that is currently serving as a wine cav for my partner and I, I made this app called "clost cav". Right now users are able to login, add wine to their cav, delete wine they've consumed, and add special wines to a favorites list so they can be sure to pick some more up.

## Plans for the future

I originally conceived of this project for my partner and I so there are three logins, one for each of us and a guest log in so people can check out the app. I may in the future open this up so anyone can register can keep track of any wine living under their bed, in a closet, above the fridge (please not there it's too hot), or just squirreled away in a corner. If you'd like to have a look at the app just shoot me an email and I'll get you in.

In the near future there will be a "cellar" feature the functionality of which is still up for debate, essentially a reserve list of some sort. As well as the ability to add multiple bottles to a single entry.
